My third Pygame project!! 

A seemingly simple platformer that my friends had a really hard time beating while they play-tested it. I wanted to learn how to import a tileset and the logic of multiple levels without the use of seperate functions for each level, but rather one function that can change
the level. Basically a OOP approach, of course. I added a level select because it is not my intention for somebody to miss out on content because they cannot complete a level, I just want to show off my work.
While creating this game i unknowingly set myself a lot of boundries which limited my development, such as the tileset being very small which caused the character to be very small (10 * 8 pixels) which limited me a lot. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and will not make
the same mistakes in my next game, but rather I will make new mistakes! :D

Explanation of the name: Up until the very end of this project, it was called "new_project". There were really no distinguishable characteristics that would help me name this game. It a simple and generic platformer But when my friends play-tested it, one of them said 
that I should name it "Eat your guts" because you want to eat yourself while you play it (Bosnian: "Trebao bi je nazvati "Eat you guts" jer zelis da je pojedes dok je igraš koliko umireš).

To play the game, run the "Eat Your Guts.lnk". I made it a shortcut for ease of use.

Enjoy !!
