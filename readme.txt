My third Pygame project!! 

A simple platformer with shoot mechanics, enemies and spikes.
While creating this game i unknowingly set myself a lot of boundries which limited my development, such as the tileset being very small which caused the character to be very small (7 * 15 pixels) which limited me a lot. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and will not make the same mistakes in my next game, but rather I will make new mistakes! :D

Explanation of the name: Up until the very end of this project, it was called "new_project". There were really no distinguishable characteristics that would help me name this game. It a simple and generic platformer But when my friends play-tested it, one of them said that I should name it "Eat your guts" because you want to eat yourself while you play it (Bosnian: "Trebao bi je nazvati "Eat you guts"jer želis da je pojedeš dok je igraš koliko umireš).

To play the game, go into the "dist" folder and run main.exe. 
Windows may detect it as a virus because Windows flags programs made with PyInstaller as a virus as a result of many people making viruses with PyInstaller.

Enjoy !!
